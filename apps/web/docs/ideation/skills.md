# TO DO

NOTE: The default agent will contain all tools.

1. Add missing UI elements in Chat (loading tools & tools UI)
2. Add Google Sheet Skill to the default agent
3. Refine system prompt & agent instructions to be able to use the Google Sheet tool

NEXT STEPS

4. Add a new tool for "requesting user information". The basic version of this tool will only include text. In the future, this new tool may render a form. Or it may render an Artifact...
